#Summary:
  The game of boggle is centered around a player or players finding words on a 5x5 grid of die. The die are all randomized and then players are to find words horizontally, vertically, diagonally, and in a criss-cross fashion. There is a one-player option in which the player tries to beat the clock and there is a two-player option in which each player gets 15 seconds to find a word until a certain points limit is reached or time runs out. Many restrictions are placed on the game, such as word minimum lengths, a time limit, and a point score to reach. Each letter of the word is a point.
